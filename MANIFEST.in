# stuff we need to include into the sdist is handled automatically by
# setuptools_scm - it includes all git-committed files.
# but we want to include some non-committed files/dirs needed in
# the sdist and exclude some committed files/dirs not needed in the sdist:
exclude .gitattributes .gitignore .travis.yml
exclude manage.py requirements.txt
prune .tx
prune logo
prune scripts/travis
