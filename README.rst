Features
========

* Frontend: Dynamic DNS updates via dyndns2 protocol (like supported
  by many DSL/cable routers and client software).
* Backends:

  - Uses Dynamic DNS UPDATE protocol (RFC 2136) to update compatible
    nameservers like BIND, PowerDNS and others (the nameserver itself is
    **not** included).
  - Optionally uses the dyndns2 protocol to update other services - we can
    send updates to configurable third-party services when we receive an
    update from the router / update client.

* Prominently shows visitor's IP addresses (v4 and v6) on main view,
  shows reverse DNS lookup results (on host overview view).
* Multiple Hosts per user (using separate secrets for security)
* Add own domains / nameservers (public or only for yourself)
* Related Hosts: support updating DNS records of other hosts in same LAN by
  a single updater (e.g. for IPv6 with changing prefix, IPv4 also works)
* Login with local or remote accounts (Google, GitHub, Bitbucket, ...
  accounts - everything supported by the python-social-auth package)
* Manual IP updates via web interface
* Browser-based update client for temporary/adhoc usage
* Shows time since last update via API, whether it used TLS or not
* Shows IP v4 and v6 addresses (from master nameserver records)
* Shows client / server fault counters, available and abuse flags
* Supports IP v4 and v6, TLS.
* Easy and simple web interface, it tries to actively help to configure
  routers / update clients / nameservers.
* Made with security and privacy in mind
* No nagging, no spamming, no ads - trying not to annoy users
* Free and open source software, made with Python and Django
