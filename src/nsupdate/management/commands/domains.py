Your domain: %(domain)s (comment: %(comment)s)

Issue: The nameserver of the domain is not reachable and was set to not available
       (and also to not public, in case it was public).

Explanation:
You created the domain on our service and entered a primary nameserver IP for it.
We tried to query that nameserver but it either was not reachable or it did not
answer queries for this domain.

Resolution:
If you really want that domain to work and you really control that nameserver:

1. fix the nameserver so it responds to queries for this domain
2. make sure the nameserver is reachable from us
3. make sure it accepts dynamic updates for hosts in this domain
4. make sure it uses the same secret as configured on the service
5. set the domain to "available" on the service
6. check if the "public" flag is correctly

Alternatively, if you do not use the domain with our service, delete the
domain entry, so it is removed from our database. This will also remove all
hosts that were added to this domain (if any).
