Explanation:
You created the host on our service, but it has not been updated for a very long time.

That might be because:
* you don't use the host/service any more, but forgot to delete the host
* host IP never changed and thus did not require an update
* your update credentials are wrong and thus updates are not working
* your updater is malfunctioning and not sending updates

We can't know what the reason is. But please understand that we do not want to
accumulate unused hosts in our database, so please help resolving this issue.

We will send some notifications like this to remind you to resolve this.
If you do not react and resolve this, your host will first be made unavailable
and later it will be deleted.

Resolution:
* if you still use the host:
  - if your host was switched to unavailable, you first need to manually set
    it to available again (via the web interface).
  - send an update for it (you can do that via the web interface or by just
    accessing the update URL or by forcing your update software to send an
    update). An update with same IP is acceptable in this case.
* if you do not use the host any more, please delete it from the service

Hint: to avoid this issue for static or mostly-static IP hosts, consider
sending 1 unconditional update every month. some dyndns2 compatible updaters
can do that, too.

Explanation:
You created the host on our service, but it has not been updated for a very long time.

We sent you some email notifications about this, but you never reacted to them.
Thus, we assume that you do not need the host any more and have DELETED it.

Feel free to re-create it on our service in case you need it again at some
time.
